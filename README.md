# COSC 499 Exercise 1

Welcome! This repository serves solely as part of an assignment for UBCO COSC 499.
It consists of three classes:
  ## Demo 
    We have code for running methods in the feature classes. This is where the main method locates.
  ## Feature 1
  ### int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s):
    Given a String, we find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
```java
	System.out.println(Feature1.lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));//gives you three
```
  ## Feature 2
  ### String longestPalindrome(String s):
    Given a String, we find the longest substring that is a palindrome
```java
	System.out.println(Feature2.longestPalindrome("cbbd"));//gives you "bb"
```
